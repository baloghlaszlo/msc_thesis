First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, \advisori, as without his guidance in the last five years I could not create such a work as this thesis.

I would also like to thank my two other advisors \advisorii, and \advisoriii, without their help in formalization and algorithmization would have been way more cumbersome.

I would like to thank Oszk치r Semer치th as without his help the measurements would have been a lot harder.

And last, but not least, I would like to thank Krist칩f Marussy, and B치lint Hegyi for helping me with L\textsc{a}T\textsc{e}X and Ti\emph{k}Z related issues, to help me create such a beautiful document.
