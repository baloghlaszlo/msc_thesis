Assuring the correctness of critical systems is important as their failure might cause huge loss.
Nowadays the application of runtime verification is an emerging trend in the safety-critical and cyber-physical system, to increase safety, as in case of a failure in these systems there is always a large amount of money or human lives at stake. 

However, designing and implementing runtime analysis is a complex task. The manual implementation is expensive, the resulting system will be complex, and the faultless operation is not assured.
There is a huge need for languages to define the requirements of safety-critical systems.
Moreover, there is also a need for certainty in the verification component, and this need makes design time verification and formal model checking desirable. 

The motivation of my work is to enhance the available approaches and take one step towards an expressive formalism to support runtime analysis of complex systems.
The goal of the paper is to find an intermediate language which can bridge the gap between system level requirements and their runtime verification.
